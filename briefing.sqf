In addition, November has been confirmed to be extremely radioactive. With that in mind, you should maintain CBRN security at all times.<br />In order to limit exposure, make sure you are wearing a CBRN suit and a mask. Carrying a Combination Chemical Detector/Geiger Counter (CCDGC) will give you a visual and audio heads-up when there is a nearby source of radiation.<br />Keep an eye on the 'Threat' value, a mask alone will only protect you up to a threat of 7.00, past that, you will need a CBRN suit to ensure your safety.<br />The CCDGC will emit an audible beeping when it detects radiation, the frequency of the beeping should increase with proximity to the source. It might be possible to track November using the CCDGC if it is not properly contained."]];

Make sure you understand the mission objectives and be prepared to adapt. Once you are ready to start the mission, board the UH-60 on the deck of the USS Freedom and it will deliver you to the <marker name='markerInsertion'>insertion point</marker> We don't know what the situation is on the ground, we don't know if you'll encounter hostiles and we don't know if November will even still be at the site. Stay aware, assume any one you see is hostile, remember your CBRN training and try to get the drop on anyone you encounter."]];
player createDiaryRecord ["Diary", ["Mission", "Your mission objectives are simple:<br />- Find the nuclear material (November).<br />- Secure the material for transport.<br />- Cover Pegasus while they retrieve the package.<br />Recovering the crew from Hermes should be considered of secondary importance. If there are survivors then take them with you to the evac point. We cannot risk November.<br />Once your mission objectives are completed head to the evac point, west of the area of operations and get ready for retasking."]];
player createDiaryRecord ["Diary", ["Situation", "April 11, 1992.<br />Six months ago, the former People's Republic of Chernarus descended into chaos. Civil war between the Soviet-backed communist government and factions demanding regime change have left Chernarus a war-torn and desolate wasteland. In line with NATO's policy of containment, we have been secretly providing anti-government forces with weapons, materials and expertise.<br />Late last month we received information that a Soviet research facility in Chernogorsk had been overrun by anti-government forces. In that facility, materials from several top-secret Soviet research projects were captured, including some highly radioactive material. We made a deal with the rebels that they would hand over the contents of the facility to us. The materials were to be flown out of the country on a military C-130, ostensibly on a mission to deliver aid. The aircraft (callsign Hermes) was supposed to leave via the abandoned airstrip west of Chernogorsk yesterday. We have had no communications from Hermes since they recieved the materials from the rebels, and we have to assume the worst. <br />We don't fully understand the nature of that material, but it is vitally important that the Soviets do not recover it. To facilitate the materials recovery, the USS Freedom has been made available from its deployment in the Green Sea region."]];
